In this demo, you will be discovering, step by step, how to build a personal portfolio with the help of a number of tools that composes MERN stack; MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJs.The portfolio will feature information about myself, what projects I have made, what skills I've used in making those projects, certifications I have accomplished and will include a contact form for recruiters.

What tools do you need to build a portfolio like mine?

To go through the entire process of creating our app from start to deployment, you will need to have the following:
Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it at nodejs.org.
Git installed on your computer. You can download it at git-scm.com.
Using VS Code as your code editor. You can download it at code.visualstudio.com.
A free Netlify account at netlify.com; or pushing our app to the web.
A free GitHub account at github.com.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

However, since I'm just working with one page, I can within our app component figure out the different components that I need very quickly. It will be shown a Navbar on top with all of the links to jump to different sections of my portfolio.

After that, It will included an about section, a section for my projects, education, certifications and finally a contact form.
