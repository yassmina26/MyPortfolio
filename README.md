What Tools Do I Need to Build my Portfolio?

To go through the entire process of creating our app from start to deployment, you will need to have the following:
Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it at nodejs.org.
Git installed on your computer. You can download it at git-scm.com.
Using VS Code as your code editor. You can download it at code.visualstudio.com.
A free Netlify account at netlify.com; or pushing our app to the web.
A free GitHub account at github.com.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

However, since we're just working with one page, we can within our app component figure out the different components that we need very quickly. We will have a Navbar on top with all of the links to jump to different sections of our portfolio.

After that, we will include an about section, a section for our projects, education, experience and finally our contact form.
